# Bachelor and Master thesis projects
We are always interested in talented students who want to write their thesis with us. 
Please write an e-mail to [Robert Bamler]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/1rob.md %}) with a rough outline of topics you are interested in and the 
time frame in which you plan to write your thesis. Feel free to also send the mail to one of our PhD 
students whose work you are particularly interested in. 

# Research Assistants
We are currently not actively looking for research assistants. If you are interested and have an idea for a project you can work on, 
you can write an e-mail to [Robert Bamler]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/1rob.md %}).
