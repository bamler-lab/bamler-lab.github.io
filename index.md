## About us

We were the research group for data science and machine learning at the Cluster of Excellence "Machine Learning for Science" at University of Tübingen.
Our research group was headed by [Robert Bamler](https://robamler.github.io), who has now moved to a new position in the MPEG-AI team at Nokia in Munich.
This website will remain online for a while since the PhD students are still at University of Tübingen, with new advisors.


## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to my students for setting up and maintaining this site, especially to [Alexander Conzelmann](people/alex_c), who set up the jekyll infrastructure.
