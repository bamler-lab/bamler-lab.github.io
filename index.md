Put a group picture!

## About us
We are the <groupname?> research group of the Machine Learning Cluster of Excellence at the University of Tübingen.

In our group, we develop new and practical methods for approximate Bayesian Inference and other areas of Probabilistic Machine Learning. 
We work on a diverse range of applications, including for example Variational Autoencoders, Neural Data Compression and Monte Carlo Sampling. 

Our research group is headed by [Prof. Robert Bamler](https://robamler.github.io). 

## Contact 
If you are interested in working or collaborating with us, don't hesitate to visit us in Tübingen (Maria-von-Linden-Str. 6, 4th floor),
