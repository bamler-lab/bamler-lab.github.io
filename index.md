## About us

We are the research group for data science and machine learning at the Cluster of Excellence "Machine Learning for Science" at University of Tübingen.

Our group performs research at the interface of deep learning and scalable probabilistic inference methods that combine algorithmic approaches with efficient approximations.
We work on a diverse range of applications, including uncertainty quantification, sampling, neural data and model compression, and natural sciences.

Our research group is headed by [Prof. Robert Bamler](https://robamler.github.io). 

## Contact

We are located on at the 4th floor of Maria-von-Linden-Str. 6, 72076 Tübingen, Germany.
If you are interested in working or collaborating with us, please don't hesitate to reach out to <robert.bamler@uni-tuebingen.de>.
