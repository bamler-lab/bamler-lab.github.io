## About

I am a PhD student specializing in the field of probabilistic inference and deep probabilistic models.
I joined this research group in late 2021 as a Master's student and successfully completed my Master's thesis in mid 2022 on the topic *Machine Learning for Thermodynamics: Equipping Data Driven Prediction Methods with Chemical Prior Knowledge*. 
Since July 2022 I am a PhD student working on approximate Bayesian inference and Machine Learning for science.


## Research Interests

My research interests primarily revolve around the development of flexible and efficient inference methods for deep probabilistic models.
In general, exact probabilistic inference is challenging and one has to resort to approximations. 
Methods for approximate probabilistic inference fall into two categories that trade off accuracy (Markov Chain Monte Carlo, MCMC) and scalability and speed (Variational Inference, VI).
I am looking into (differentiable) combinations of VI and MCMC that combine the strengths of both approaches.
Recently, I am also very excited about diffusion models which exhibit interesting connections to both VI and MCMC.

In addition to my focus on inference methods, I am passionate about the application of Probabilistic Machine Learning (PML) in the natural sciences.
Given the often limited availability of data in scientific domains, PML is a natural choice.
My work centers around the prediction of physicochemical properties of binary liquid mixtures. 
More specifically, I am working on the prediction of physicochemical properties of binary liquid mixtures with a probabilistic matrix factorization that learns a prior distribution directly from chemical knowledge (e.g., atoms and bonds).


## Collaborations and Student Projects

I actively seek opportunities for collaboration on compelling research topics. 
If you find that our research interests align or if you simply wish to discuss on a particular subject, please [reach out](mailto:johannes.zenn@uni-tuebingen.de)!

I have several ideas for engaging student projects, including Bachelor's theses and Master's theses. 
Please don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:johannes.zenn@uni-tuebingen.de) if you have any questions or would like to explore potential projects.
