## About

I used to lead the group as a professor of Data Science and Machine Learning until October 2020 but I've now moved on to a new position in the MPEG-AI team at Nokia.

I joined University of TÃ¼bingen and the Cluster of Excellence for Machine Learning in November 2020.
Before this, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the statistical machine learning group of UC Irvine lead by Stephan Mandt, and before that I was a machine learning researcher at Disney Research in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles.
I received my PhD in theoretical statistical and quantum physics from University of Cologne in 2016, advised by Achim Rosch and with support from German Telekom Foundation.

You can find a list of my publications on my [personal website](https://robamler.github.io/).
