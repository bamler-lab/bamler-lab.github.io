## About

I am a Professor of Data Science and Machine Learning at University of Tübingen, Germany, and a member of the Cluster of Excellence "Machine Learning: New Perspectives for Science" and Tübingen AI Center.

My group performs research at the interface of deep learning and scalable probabilistic inference methods that combine algorithmic approaches with efficient approximations.
We work on a diverse range of applications, including uncertainty quantification, sampling, neural data and model compression, and natural sciences.

I joined University of Tübingen and the Cluster of Excellence for Machine Learning in November 2020.
Before this, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the statistical machine learning group of UC Irvine lead by Stephan Mandt, and before that I was a machine learning researcher at Disney Research in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles.
I received my PhD in theoretical statistical and quantum physics from University of Cologne in 2016, advised by Achim Rosch and with support from German Telekom Foundation.

You can find a list of my publications on my [personal website](https://robamler.github.io/).
