## About
I am a PhD student working on neural network compression that involves both efficient inference as well as storage reduction. The techniques I am
focussing on involve quantisation, pruning and entropy coding of neural network weights.

I joined the research group in 2022 as research assistant working on (Zipnet)[https://conzel.github.io/zipnet/], a neural image compressor that is completely browser based. In the beginning of 2023, I joined the research group as a full-time PhD student.
