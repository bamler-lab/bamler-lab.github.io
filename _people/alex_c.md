## About
I am a PhD student working on data compression using neural networks. At the moment, I am focussing my attention on climate data, 
as there are huge amounts of data generated every day in the field which could benefit immensely from data compression.

I joined the research group in 2022 as research assistant working on (Zipnet)[https://conzel.github.io/zipnet/], a neural image compressor that is completely browser based. In the beginning of 2023, I joined the research group as a full-time PhD student.
